/**
 * The application logo: the operator's for the active theme, or the platform's own.
 *
 * The fallback is per slot rather than per brand. An operator who has uploaded only a light logo gets their logo in
 * the light theme and the platform's mark in the dark one, rather than no logo at all - which matters because Core's
 * per-field fallback means a half-uploaded brand can exist even though the Appearance tab will not save one.
 *
 * The logo is always an `img` with the data URI as its `src`, and no code path inlines SVG markup into the document.
 * Core sanitizes an uploaded SVG, and this is the second half of that defence: an `img` renders SVG inert, so a script
 * that survived sanitization still never executes - including for the anonymous visitors on the login page.
 *
 * Nothing is shown until the branding read settles. The colours and the operator's default theme are both cached for
 * the first paint, but a logo cannot join them: Core permits a mebibyte per slot, so caching two of them would claim
 * most of the origin's storage quota. Without a cache, treating "not read yet" as "no logo uploaded" would paint the
 * platform mark on every cold load of a branded instance and then swap it - the operator's own logo arriving as a
 * visible correction to the wrong one. The platform mark is therefore rendered from the start, so it reserves its own
 * space and decodes, but stays invisible until the answer is in; the cost is that an unbranded instance shows no logo
 * for the length of one request it has already issued.
