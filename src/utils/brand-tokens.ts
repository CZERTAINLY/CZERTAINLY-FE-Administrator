/**
 * Turns the operator's four brand colours into an override layer over the semantic colour tokens.
 *
 * Four inputs cannot drive thirty tokens one-to-one, so each input drives a *family* and the intermediate steps are
 * derived rather than configured. The derivations live in one table, {@link BRAND_TOKEN_RULES}, which is rendered two
 * ways: to CSS by {@link brandTokenCss}, for the browser to mix, and to concrete hex by {@link brandTokenValues}, for
 * anything that has to know a derived colour before it is painted. Both readings describe the same colours, which is
 * what lets a caller measure what the page will actually show.
 *
 * The overrides are emitted as a separate stylesheet rather than by editing `tailwindcss.css`, for two reasons. An
 * unbranded instance then produces no override at all, so its rendering is unchanged by construction rather than by
 * a fallback that has to be kept in step with the platform palette; and the two selectors used here -
 * `html:not(.dark)` and `html.dark` - outrank the base `:root` and `.dark` blocks on specificity, so the layer wins
 * without depending on where the browser happens to order the stylesheets.
 *
 * Values are written to the tier-2 custom properties (`--brand`, `--surface`, ...). The `--color-*` names are never
 * written: `@theme inline` does not emit those into `:root`, it only feeds Tailwind's utility generator, so setting
 * one parses and resolves to nothing.

 * inverted to derive the other theme - the dark composition keeps its own surfaces and content, which is what keeps it
 * readable whatever the operator chose against a light page.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, and not to be added without a design decision: `success`, `danger` and `warning`, which must
 * keep their conventional meaning; the `node-*` family, which encodes certificate status in the flow chart;
 * `content-inverse` and `content-on-brand`, which are the fixed foregrounds the branded fills are measured against;
 * and `divider`, `outline` and `code-color`.
 *
 * The weights reproduce the relationships the platform palette already has - a hover a step darker, a subtle surface a
 * wash of the same hue, a dark-theme foreground lightened for contrast - so a brand set to the platform's own blue
 * lands close to the platform's own look: the dark-theme lift of 30% white takes it to 6.4:1 against the dark card,
 * where the platform's own hand-picked value sits at 6.1:1.
 *
 * A fixed lift cannot rescue every input. A near-black Primary stays under AA as a dark-theme link however it is
 * mixed, and lifting it far enough to pass would no longer be the colour the operator chose - so the mapping does not
 * silently correct it. Measuring a derived colour against its background is {@link brandTokenValues}' purpose, and
 * what a caller does about a pairing that falls short is the caller's decision, not this table's.
